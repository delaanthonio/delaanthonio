# Hi, I'm Dela 👋

Senior Backend Engineer who ships production-ready services with built-in operational excellence. I specialize in the unglamorous but critical work of modernizing legacy systems - the kind of migrations that have been "planned for next quarter" for three years.

## 🎯 What I Do

I'm the engineer teams call when:
- They need to migrate something with zero downtime (like that time I moved production traffic between Kubernetes ingress controllers using regex routing)
- Senior engineers want a second opinion on observability strategy
- A legacy system needs to be surgically decomposed without breaking everything
- Someone needs to bridge the gap between "it works on my machine" and "it runs reliably in production"

## 🔧 Technical Focus

```python
# My sweet spot: Backend services that don't wake anyone up at 3am
expertise = {
    "languages": ["Python", "TypeScript", "SQL"],
    "backend": ["Django", "FastAPI", "Celery"],
    "infrastructure": ["AWS", "Kubernetes", "Terraform"],
    "data": ["PostgreSQL", "Redis", "Kafka", "RabbitMQ"],
    "observability": ["New Relic", "OpenTelemetry", "Distributed Tracing"]
}

# What I'm known for
specialties = [
    "Zero-downtime migrations",
    "Legacy system modernization", 
    "Turning observability data into architectural decisions",
    "Making services self-sufficient (no DevOps handholding required)"
]
```

## 📊 Impact Over Activity

- **$1M+** daily revenue enabled through in-house carrier test processing system
- **$200k** annual savings from consolidating 8 services into 3
- **50+ endpoints** successfully migrated after analyzing 6 months of production traffic
- **27%** reduction in API surface area while maintaining all functionality
- **99.9%** uptime because I build services with monitoring baked in

## 🚀 Current Adventures

- Building SaaS products to sharpen my full-stack edge
- Exploring event-driven architectures at scale
- Contributing to internal observability best practices
- Mentoring engineers on crossing the frontend/backend divide

## 💡 Engineering Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Data over opinions**: Use production traffic to make decisions, not meeting room assumptions
- **Gradual over big bang**: Incremental migrations sleep better at night
- **Ownership over handoffs**: If I build it, I make sure it runs
- **Teaching over gatekeeping**: The best code review prevents future incidents AND teaches why

## 🛠️ Recent Technical Challenges I've Solved

### The Ingress Controller Migration Nobody Wanted to Touch
**Problem**: Monolith Django app needed to move between ingress controllers. No docs. No playbook. Just "figure it out."  
**Solution**: Collaborated with a colleague to implement regex-based routing patterns for gradual traffic migration  
**Result**: Zero downtime, zero incidents, one very relieved team

### The Portal That Wouldn't Die
**Problem**: Legacy portal marked for deprecation... 3 years ago. Multiple failed attempts.  
**Solution**: Used New Relic as an archaeological tool - 6 months of ingress logs revealed what was actually used vs what documentation claimed  
**Result**: Successfully decommissioned with surgical precision, saving ~$200k annually
